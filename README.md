# Butterfly-Effect

Simulates the behavior of a physically-accurate double pendulum.

This simulation does not account for forces other than gravity
(i.e. air resistance & friction are ignored).

There are three different modes:
  1. A normal double pendulum, where the arms and bodies are
     visible in gray and white.
  2. A double pendulum where everything is invisible except
     the second body, which isolates the movement of the double
     pendulum.
  3. A double pendulum where the bodies are invisible but the
     arms are visible. This has the option to spawn 10,000
     double pendulums with a total angle difference of 0.0001
     radians, creating a very aesthetically pleasing result.
